# British Airways Data Science Virtual Experience Program - Forage

This repository contains my work for the **British Airways Data Science Virtual Job Simulation** completed on the Forage platform.

## Overview

Through this simulation, I explored how data science plays a crucial role in British Airways' business success by:
- Scraping and analyzing customer review data.
- Uncovering patterns and generating actionable insights.
- Building a predictive model to understand the factors influencing buying behavior.

## What I Did

- **Data Collection:** Extracted and cleaned customer review data.
- **Data Analysis:** Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and key findings.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Developed a machine learning model to predict customer behavior based on review data.
- **Insights:** Interpreted the model results to provide recommendations for improving customer experience and boosting sales.

## Skills Used

- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, BeautifulSoup)
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Machine Learning (Classification Modeling)
- Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
